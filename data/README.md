# CIC_DDoS 2019


Here we house the dataset and all of the data analysis code for the paper. Experiments are held in the experiments folder. 

Our prepared datasets are generated from the original [CIC_DDoS dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ddos-2019.html). To reproduce the datasets used in these experiments, download the dataset from the link above and place it in the original folder, then open the dataset_generation.ipynb notebook and click run all.
